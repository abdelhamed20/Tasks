Threads: CPU switches between different threads really fast, giving a falsehood of concurrency.
threads are running parallel, usually in different CPU core, true concurrency.When one thread is running, others are blocked
It's a must for not instant running processes that interact with each other.
its using a strategy of do different things together.

Parallel processing:threads are running parallel, usually in different CPU core, true concurrency.
mlutiple threads are running at any given time. It's useful for heavy computations, super long running processes.
Same thing with a fleet of single core machines, split data into sections for each machine to compute,
pool them together at the end.
its using a strategy of do one thing in less time.
