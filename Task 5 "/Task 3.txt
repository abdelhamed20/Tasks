what is BIOS:
BIOS is a program, stands for basic input/output system, which is stored in nonvolatile memory like ROM
(Read Only Memory) that allows you to set up and access your computer system at the greatest basic level.
It is found on motherboards that are a pre-installed program on Windows-based computers that executes when a computer
is powered up. Before an OS is loaded, the CPU accesses the basic input/output system (BIOS). Then, the next function of
BIOS is to examine all the hardware connections and detects all your devices.
why do we use it:
A BIOS contains the instructions your computer needs to load its basic hardware, including the POST mentioned above.
If your system fails the POST,you will hear a series of beeps; different beep sequences indicate various issues.
