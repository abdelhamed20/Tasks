John von Neumann architecture: The computer we are using nowadays is based on the von Neumann architecture.
It has some concepts. It is also known as Princeton architecture.
It renders a unique design for the electronic digital systems having the following components:

A Central Processing Unit (CPU) with arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) and processors with attached registers.
A memory that can store data and instructions.
External mass storage or secondary storage.
A Control Unit (CU) with the ability to hold instructions in the program counter (PC) or instruction register (IR).
Input and output mechanisms and peripherals.

Harvard Architecture:consists of code and data laid in distinct memory sections.
It requires a separate memory block for data and instruction. 
It has solely contained data storage within the Central Processing Unit (CPU). 
A single collection of clock cycles is needed. Data accessibility in one memory is done by a single memory location in the
case of Harvard architecture.
One typical example is the Punch card. Moreover, modern computers may have the latest CPU processes for both methods
but disparate them in a hardware design.

comparison between the two:
required space : harvard architecture needs more space to work. 
Devolopment cost: harvard architecture needs more cost to be built.
Efficiency: harvard architecture is more efficient.
Execution speed: harvard architecture has higher speed.
Performance offered: harvard architecture is better in performance.

so in conclusion Harvard architecture is somewhat an improvisation in Von Neumann architecture by offering a
comparatively better design thereby providing simultaneous execution
