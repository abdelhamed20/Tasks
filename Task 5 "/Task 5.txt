what is fragmentation :Fragmentation is an unwanted problem in the operating system in which the processes are loaded and
unloaded from memory, and free memory space is fragmented. Processes can't be assigned to memory blocks due to their small
size, and the memory blocks stay unused. It is also necessary to understand that as programs are loaded and deleted from 
memory, they generate free space or a hole in the memory. These small blocks cannot be allotted to new arriving processes, 
resulting in inefficient memory use.

types of fragmentation :

1- Internal Fragmentation: When a process is allocated to a memory block, and if the process is smaller than the amount
of memory requested, a free space is created in the given memory block. Due to this, the free space of the memory block 
is unused, which causes internal fragmentation.

2-External Fragmentation: External fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation method allocates some memory
but leaves a small amount of memory unusable. The quantity of available memory is substantially reduced if there is 
too much external fragmentation. There is enough memory space to complete a request, but it is not contiguous. 
It's known as external fragmentation.
