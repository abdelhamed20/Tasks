what is a clean code:Clean code is not a set of strict rules. It is a set of principles for writing code that is easy to
understand and modify by any experienced devoloper.
Principles of clean code:

KISS(Keep It Simple,Stupid):is one of the oldest principles of clean code. It was being used by the US military as early as
the 1960s. KISS encourages programmers to write their code as simply as possible. You should avoid making your code
unnecessarily complex

DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself): is a more specific version of KISS. According to the DRY principle,
functions in clean code should only do one thing within the overall system.

YAGNI(You aren’t gonna need it):is based on the following idea: a developer should only introduce additional functionality
to code when it is necessary. YAGNI is closely tied to agile software development methods. According to the YAGNI principle,
instead of starting from an overarching concept during development, you should program the software architecture in small
steps to be able to react to problems dynamically and individually.

Readability over conciseness:Code needs to work and be understood by the machine executing it. However, 
other developers also need to be able to understand the code, especially if you are working on a project with multiple 
people. That is why the readability of code is always more important than its conciseness when it comes to software 
development.
