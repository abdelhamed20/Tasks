what is RDA:is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans
actions interacting with digital systems and software. Just like people, software robots can do things like understand
what’s on a screen, complete the right keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide
range of defined actions.Robotic process automation streamlines workflows, which makes organizations more profitable,
flexible, and responsive. It also increases employee satisfaction, engagement, and productivity by removing mundane tasks 
from their workdays. RPA is noninvasive and can be rapidly implemented to accelerate digital transformation. 
And it’s ideal for automating workflows that involve legacy systems that lack APIs, virtual desktop infrastructures (VDIs),
or database access.
